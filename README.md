# RTFM: A Documentation Server

This is a private documentation server, initially designed for use with
RDoc, but it can really be used with any HTML-formatted documentation
like Doxygen or Javadoc. It's a basic Rack app that serves documentation
from a specific directory, and gives you a nice little front page for
navigation.
