# RTFM is TelVue's personal documentation server. It's very simple,
# producing a single index template that renders out every subdirectory
# of `/srv/doc`, with hyperlinks to their documentation. It should list
# out every viewable documentation repository we have on
# http://rtfm.teve.inc/. Mounted as the index page, it's a great way for
# people to find out about new projects as well as developers to
# navigate all of the documentation we have.

module RTFM
  # Code goes here.
